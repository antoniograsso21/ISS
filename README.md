## Requirements
In a home of a given city (e.g. Bologna), a ddr robot is used to clean the floor of a room (R-FloorClean).
The floor in the room is a flat floor of solid material and is equipped with two sonars, named sonar1 and
sonar2 as shown in the picture (sonar1 is that at the top). The initial position (start-point) of the robot is
detected by sonar1, while the final position (end-point) is detected by sonar2.
